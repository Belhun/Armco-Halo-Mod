**ARMCO Halo Mod Update 1.0**

Hello @everyone /ARMCO! Today(tehcnicaly released it 2 days ago) marks the release of the ARMCO Halo Mod, Witch is a retexture mod adding Armco Style Stuff into Arma, useing Optre as a base, A Huge Thank you to @Mrtrubshaw#1888 and @ùïØùñÜùñóùñêùñìùñäùñòùñòùñõùñîùñéùñâùü°ùü°#3744 for the Help on this Update from the ARMCO Workshop Discord. 

This is a recode of a mod maintained by Gunner and created by Mac and Frosty a long time ago. However, that mod had many issues, and much of it was done inefficiently and wasn't updated for the newer features from OPTRE. Because of this, I have gone through and recoded everything, along with putting the entire mod onto GitHub and making it easy to read and understand, allowing anyone who wants to take a look at how it's done to do so. The only real things brought over from the old mod are textures for most items, except for Warthogs (I had to redo those myself with input from the community) and some of the new BDUs. With the complete rewrite, these are all the things that have been added to this version.

If you have questions, feel free to DM me, and if you want to learn how to make these things, please join the workshop. I would love to teach or show you how this works.

**Removed:** All old code for the previous mod has been removed. Additionally, I did not re-add Green Horn Stuff, Rescue Services stuff, or custom armors for people who haven't been active in a long time or have left the unit. If you rejoin or had armor in the past and don't have it anymore, you can message me and let me know, and I'll add you to the list of people who need their armor added back in.

**Custom Stuff:**
So, the old mod had a bunch of custom ODST armor. These armors are for people who completed the ODST certification, now known as SRU Certification. To be fair, this certification hasn't happened in a long time. The other mod makers and I are in contact with command to hopefully get those certification missions running again. But until then, as a rule of thumb, if you use this mod and give people access to their custom armor in a mission, make sure you allow people to at least take the squad ODST armor. Please and thank you.

**Things to look out for:**
Re-adding Greenhorn Armor, Backpacks, and Vehicles.
Colonial (Police, Firefighter, Medical)
BDU Retextures
Helmet Retextures
Maybe more? We will see.

GitHub:
This project is entirely open-source, and you can take a look at our license on the GitHub. It will remain so for as long as I take the lead on this mod. It's run by the community and is only led by me. If, for some reason, I stop working on this mod, decisions about what comes and goes in the mod will be left to command, and in no way will the mod's assets be revoked by me. I just want to be clear and state that for the record. Also, if the community wants something added to the mod, go for it! You can pull the GitHub, add the things you want, and push it to the main branch. I will review it to ensure it doesn't break any rules and that the code looks neat. Keep in mind, though, that all assets added to this mod belong to ARMCO/4th Command. This is a personal choice on my part to keep this mod as open and fair as possible.
if you want to take a look at what we are working on we also have a public project area that shows what we are working on
